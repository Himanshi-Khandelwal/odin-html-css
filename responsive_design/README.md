# Responsive Design

[The Next Web](http://thenextweb.com/)'s responsive and fluid homepage is cloned for The Odin Project's [Project: Responsive Design (with The Next Web)](http://www.theodinproject.com/html5-and-css3/building-with-responsive-design).

Currently, simple fillers are used for the Header and Sidebar of the webpage.
Media queries are used to resize and reposition the various elements of the webpage as the size of the window is changed, gracefully degrading the site.
