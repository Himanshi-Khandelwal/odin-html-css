# HTML Forms

Project to practice creating and styling HTML forms for The Odin Project's [Project: HTML Forms (with Mint)](http://www.theodinproject.com/html5-and-css3/html-forms).

A clone of [Mint's sign up page](https://wwws.mint.com/login.event?task=S) is made. The sign up form (and the rest of the page) is replicated with HTML and styled with CSS.

[Preview the Mint clone here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/donaldali/odin-html-css/blob/master/html_forms/index.html).
